\BackBody{Multiword expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for both the natural language applications
and the linguistic  theory because they often defy the application of the machinery
developed for free combinations where the default is that the meaning of an utterance can
be predicted from its structure.

There is a rich body of primarily descriptive work on MWEs for many European languages
but comparative work is little. The volume brings together MWE experts to explore the
benefits of a multilingual perspective on MWEs. The ten contributions in this volume look at
MWEs in Bulgarian, English, French, German, Maori, Modern Greek, Romanian, Serbian,
and Spanish. They discuss prominent issues in MWE research such as classification of MWEs,
their formal grammatical modeling, and the description of individual MWE types from the
point of view of different theoretical frameworks, such as Dependency Grammar, Generative
Grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical  Functional Grammar, Lexicon
Grammar.}
